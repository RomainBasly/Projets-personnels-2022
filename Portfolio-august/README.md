## Portfolio 2022
This project has been created to practice on my own with React.JS and only HTML/CSS basis.

First, I made a storyboard of what I imagined for my portfolio : https://excalidraw.com/#json=KxP9WA_ylTtoNA0zm6amg,LqV0n73m8hKv7_xt_o5ESQ

Then, I looked at what other developers have created for their portfolio. 
For the most part, my main source of inspiration was Britanny Chiang : https://brittanychiang.com/ 

As first version, I decided not to create introductory transitions as she does, but some leads of improvement exists there with GSAP.
I wanted also to use three.js to make some things in 3D, before concentrating my efforts towards a full functional portfolio (these might also be leads to improve this website).

The Youtuber Brian Design was also a source of inspiration for the smooth scrool and the navbar logic : https://youtu.be/Nl54MJDR2p8

For the logo, I have decided to use the services of LogoMakr : LogoMakr.com/app

My key learnings are : discovering styled components and their logic, although I began with a separate stylesheet for my original navbar.


## Ok now talk to me about the setup
## Before all run the command git clone

## In your cloned folder run
### `npm install`




##Documentation given automatically by react
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
