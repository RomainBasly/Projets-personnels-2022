## Pimp My Ride

This project has been completed in two weeks with a team of 4 people.
Our task was to call an API and then render it to the browser.

We have decided to call the public API of Paris Velib, ask the client to indicate its location, and then indicate him where the 3 closest stations are, the number of bikes (electric, mechanical and dokes).

For that, we have worked with HTML, CSS + bootsrap, Vanilla JS.

For the map, we have used MapBox to render a map. 

For the front, we get inspired Nodle Network Website for the video. For the video credit ("Poursuite d'un coursier sur les Grands Boulevards"): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTT4WX8ZOD8

For the Music, the credits go to Queen and their song "BiCycle Race".
