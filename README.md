Some personal projects and workshops made during my scholarship @ADA Tech School (january 2022 to november 2023)

# Some project to practice

## Fetching from Coingecko 
#2 Creating a simple page to fetch DATA from Coingecko APIs and display it simply to visualize the results - around 14th of April, 2022.
Language used : HTML, CSS & JS

My key learning are : 
- On HTML - CSS : manipulating an invented grid, incorporating a background-attachment image, incorporating several logos on specific parts of the screen.
- On JS : fetching data from several APIs (promises, .then method, async and await), manipulating JSON objects, injecting data into the HTML, making some basic math calculation around the data to display it on the screen.

Result tested on Safari & Brave (Chromium) - April 2022.
